Computer Graphics Project 1 - Line Drawing Algorithms

In this project, we consider the two line drawing algorithms - Simple Line Drawing algorithm and Bresenham Drawing algorithm.
Even though this is a simple line drawing application, the results comparing the two leads to very interesting results, 
with the main point being that Bresenham's algorithm is always faster or equal(in some edge cases) to the Simple Line Drawing algorithm
